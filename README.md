# Check the Zin MCP Suite

> [!NOTE]
>
> **This project is in active development**. Expect breaking changes with releases. Review the release changelog before updating.
> |:--------------------------------|
> This project is primarily built to used with local llm for personal small scale use only. Exposing this on network may pose security risk and thus not encouraged.
> |:--------------------------------|
>  This project is mainly developed for Zin MCP Servers which are below mentioned MCP Servers, But support for other MCP Servers is there and testing is also done on other MCP Servers such as Ghidra

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started 

### 1. Downlaod from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client/releases

```bash
# 1. 
unzip zin-mcp-client-<version>.zip

‚îúzin-mcp-client/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zin_mcp_client.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web_client.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_proxy.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-config.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE

# 2. Navigate to zin-mcp-client directory
cd zin-mcp-client

# 3. This project uses uv (recommended) - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.
    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet) - (Only Required Step)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# All below steps are not required.
    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in jadx-mcp-server, Set up the environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Not recommended, you can also use pip for this.
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

# The setup for zin-mcp-client is done.
```

## ü§ñ 2. Ollama Setup

<div align="center">
¬† <a href="https://ollama.com">
    <img alt="ollama" height="200px" src="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/assets/3325447/0d0b44e2-8f4a-4e99-9b52-a5c1c741c8f7">
  </a>
</div>

```bash
1. Download and Install ollama: https://ollama.com/download

If you are on linux you can directly run below command to install it:

> curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

2. Download and run any LLM that has capability to invoke tool.

For example, the llama 3.1 has capability to invoke the tool. 

You can run it using following command:

> ollama run llama3.1:8b

[Note]: Kindly note the above command will fetch the model with 4b parameters. If you have stronger hardware kindly fetch higher parameter model for better performance.

3. Serve the Ollama on API server using following command

> ollama serve

This will serve the ollama api on port 1134, you can confirm that it running using `curl` command as following:

> curl http://localhost:11434/                                                                                                                                              18:54:00
`Ollama is running`

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Config File Setup

The config file is the MCP Server configuration file that tells zin mcp client how to start the MCP Servers. 

It follows the same style as Claude's configuration file. 

Below is the sample configuration file for Zin MCP Suite Servers:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "jadx-mcp-server": {
            "command": "/path/to/uv", 
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/path/to/jadx-mcp-server/",
                "run",
                "jadx_mcp_server.py"
            ]
        },
        "apktool-mcp-server": {
		    "command": "/path/to/uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/path/to/apktool-mcp-server/",
                "run",
                "apktool_mcp_server.py"
            ]
	}
    }
}
```

Replace:

- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable
- `path/to/jadx-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you have stored the jadx-mcp-server

> [!NOTE]
>
>  The default location of config file is inside zin-mcp-client directory named `mcp-config.json`, however you can provide path to your own config file using `--config` option such as 

```bash
uv run zin_mcp_client.py --server jadx-mcp-server --model llama3.1:8b --config /home/zinjacoder/mcp-config.json 
```   

## Give it a shot

1. Run zin_mcp_client.py

```bash
uv run zin_mcp_client.py
```

2. Use `--server` option to specify server of your choice, use `--config` option to provide path to your config file, use `--model` option to use specific model, use `--debug` to enable verbose output

## If something went wrong - DEBUG and Troubleshooting

> [!NOTE]
> 
>  For low spec systems, use only one server at a time to avoid LLM hallucinations.

1. Look the logs:

- All the logs and debug information and raw traffic and interactions are stored in logs in easy to read way, If anything goes wrong check the logs.

2. Debug Mode:

- You can also use the `--debug` flag to enable debug to print each and every detail on console on runtime to help you find the issue.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee478917-c4f5-46fb-9f0e-ad31d7c33ee0

3. Open Issue:

- If you can not resolve the error on you own, use the logs and debug mode's output and provide them to us by opening an issue at https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client/issues

## Web Client
1. Done configuration mentioned above
2. Run web client using following:

```bash
uv run web_client.py
```
3. Demo of the web client is shown in video at [top](https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-is-zin-mcp-client)

## Setting up with Open Web UI

![openwebuilogo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158137808?s=200&v=4)

1. Done configuration mentioned above.
2. Run the MCP Proxy using following:

```bash
uv run mcp_proxy.py
```

3. Go to Open Web Ui portal.
4. In Open Web UI -> Settings -> Connection -> add new connection as shown in below image

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b49e4c-9818-4441-a9ee-4a7597749499)

Add the URL for MCP Proxy running on port 8000 with localhost if running locally as shown in image. You can put anything in API key.

5. Now prompt and utilize the MCP client, Plug n Play setup.

Current State Of Local LLM and MCPs:

Currently, proprietary API-based models like Anthropic‚Äôs Claude tend to be more proficient proficient at tool calling. 

However, the open-source world is advancing rapidly! Models specifically fine-tuned on function calling datasets are becoming increasingly available through Ollama. Researching models tagged with `function calling` or `tool use` on platforms like Hugging Face or [checking discussions on communities like r/LocalLLaMA is key to finding capable local options.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/search/?q=Best+open+source+LLM+for+function+calling+mcp&cId=c72f65d2-d327-41b0-8e6d-73e889385cda&iId=795a5a92-245d-42d2-ae60-47dfff7dbef0)

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap
 - [x] Web UI
 
 - [x] Integrate with Open Web UI

 - [x] Add Support HTTP based MCP Servers - Because a lot servers provide a way to make their servers act as a STDIO based.

 - [x] Add support exposing this client on network as well, Indirectly for network access - done indirectly via open web ui integration

 - [x] Store chat locally and provide chat history - done indirectly via open web ui integration

 - [ ] **END-GOAL** : Make all reverse engineering MCP Servers, bring them together, to make reverse engineering as easy as possible purely from vibes.

## To report bugs, issues, feature suggestion, Performance issue, general question, Documentation issue.
 - Kindly open an issue with respective template.

 - Tested on Mac OS and Linux environment with jadx-mcp-server, Ghidra MCP Server
